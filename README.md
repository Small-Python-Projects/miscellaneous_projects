# miscellaneous_projects
These are projects that I undertook in my own time. These were either for purposes to do with my own intrigue, or to help out with tutoring students.
As a sports fan, I attempted to develop an algorithm to judge and rank golfers on the PGA Tour via the metric of driving distance and accuracy. I also created a program to calculate the average putts per round on the Tour.
I also developed a program to amend and complete the season for the 2018-19 premier league table based on football manager simulations at the time.
My sports-related programming was put to greater use when a student required me to simulate squash matches in both the new and the old formats to study the statistical difference between the two for a study.
Finally, I wanted to create a program to be able to encode messages encoded by a Caesar cipher with no prior information. I did this by researching the statistically most common pairings of letters within the English alphabet (called 'bigrams') and cycling the message through letter shifts before these most common combinations appear.
